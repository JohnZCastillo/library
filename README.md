# Simple Library Management System

This project, developed by John Castillo, aims to create a user-friendly library management system that facilitates book borrowing, returning, and keeps track of borrowing history.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure that XAMPP is running on your system.

1. Create a new directory in the `xampp/htdocs` directory.
2. Copy the entire project files into the newly created directory.
3. Open your preferred web browser and access phpMyAdmin.
4. Create a new database named 'library' in XAMPP's MySQL.
5. Import the provided `library.sql` file into the 'library' database to set up the required tables and data.

## Database Setup

To set up the necessary tables and data, follow these steps:

1. Open phpMyAdmin in your web browser.
2. Select the 'library' database.
3. Click on the 'Import' tab.
4. Choose the `library.sql` file from the project files.
5. Click 'Go' to import the file.

Once the database is set up, you can run the library management system by accessing it through your web browser.
